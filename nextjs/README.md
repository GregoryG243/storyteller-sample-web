# Storyteller Web SDK NextJS Sample

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

- Node 18.16.1 (latest LTS version)

Note that the Storyteller Web SDK delivers compiled Javascript so does not depend on a specific NodeJS version.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following contents:

   ```
   STORYTELLER_API_KEY=[API-KEY]
   ```

   > You should replace `[API-KEY]` with your Storyteller API key. [Get in touch](mailto:hello@getstoryteller.com) to request one.

2. Run the following commands in the project directory:

   1. `npm install`
   2. `npm run dev`

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running in your browser.
