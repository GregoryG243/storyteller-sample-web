# Storyteller Web SDK React Sample

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- Node 18.16.1 (latest LTS version)

Note that the Storyteller Web SDK delivers compiled Javascript so does not depend on a specific NodeJS version.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following contents:
   
   ```
   REACT_APP_STORYTELLER_API_KEY=[API-KEY]
   ```

   > You should replace `[API-KEY]` with your Storyteller API key. [Get in touch](mailto:hello@getstoryteller.com) to request one.

   > See the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) for more information on environment variables

2. Run the following commands in the project directory:

   1. `npm install`
   2. `npm start`

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running in your browser.
